# Web-Map

In this repository, you can see sample of web-map, which includes 3 layers.<br/>
Layers:
<br    />Some locations (till 150), where films, created in entered year (on sample it's 2017), are set

Also there is main program (make_map.py), which generates maps, like sample.
Created difference depends on entered year and some charm of lucky
(it's shows not all locations of films, instead for not to overload map).

Moreover, there are some files (location.list.txt, world.json, coffee.csv) that are needed from getting
information for creating map.
